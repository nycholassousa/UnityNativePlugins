# Unity Native Plugins

This repository contains my progress in developing native Plugins for Unity

## Using
- Visual Studio Community 2015 to create native plugin
- Visual Studio Community 2017 to create the .cs file (dont need this.)
- Unity 2017.3.1f1 to test

## Observation

- I'm always compiling as x64
- Possibly some dlls have different names when compiled, so check the .cs file
